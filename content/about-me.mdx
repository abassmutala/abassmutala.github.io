## A bit about me

Hey, I'm Abass! I specialize in crafting high-calibre web apps using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Next.js**, along with **Flutter** for stellar mobile experiences. While my expertise lies in frontend development, I've delved into **Node.js** and **Laravel** for backend projects. My passion for **clean**, **responsive designs** drives my work. I'm a constant learner, staying updated with the latest trends in **web development**.

Outside coding, I enjoy immersing myself in football games, documentaries, or simply catching up on some well-deserved sleep ðŸ˜´.
