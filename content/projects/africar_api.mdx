### Overview  
The Africar API is a backend system I developed as part of an internal side project for a car rental platform, Africar. It provides essential data on car features such as transmission types, fuel types, car makes and models, and geographical data, including the 16 regions of Ghana and their respective towns.

### Technologies Used  
#### Languages
- **JavaScript** - Primary programming language for backend.

#### Backend Stack
- **Node.js** - For building the server-side API.
- **Express.js** - To create and manage routing and middleware.
- **MySQL** - For storing product, user, and order data.

#### Additional Packages
- mysql2

### Key Features
- **Car transmission types:** Products are neatly organized into categories for easy navigation.
- **Car fuel types:** Users can complete their purchase directly on the site using secure payment gateways.
- **Car makes/manufacturers:** The platform includes an admin section for managing products, orders, and categories.
- **Locations in Ghana:** The platform includes all 16 regions of Ghana and towns in each.

### Challenges & Learnings
This project was my first experience building an API. I initially found the Node.js and Express.js syntax to be a bit confusing, but I related it to how I made API calls on the frontend, which helped me understand it better. Through this process, I learned:
- How to build APIs from scratch
- How to integrate databases with an API (using MySQL)
During development, I encountered challenges related to managing secure transactions and optimizing database queries for speed and reliability. This project improved my understanding of server-side security, database indexing, and performance tuning in Node.js.

### Outcome  
The Africar API performs as expected based on my internal tests. It was an enriching experience, especially since it was a self-initiated project with no client involved.
The website successfully launched, offering users an efficient and intuitive shopping experience. The admin dashboard simplified inventory management for the client, streamlining their operations. The project received positive feedback from both the client and users.

### Future Enhancements
- Add search and filtering functionality for cars and locations

### Conclusion  
Building the Africar API was a significant learning experience, providing me with foundational knowledge in API development and database integration. The project took a month (May 2023) to complete, and I’m happy with the outcome, although there are future improvements planned.
Africar API was a crucial learning experience in managing e-commerce platforms. The project pushed me to refine my skills in API development, payment gateway integration, and performance optimization. It’s a great addition to my portfolio, highlighting my ability to deliver a functional and user-friendly web application.
