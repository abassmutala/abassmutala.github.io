### Overview

**Glico Stores** was developed as part of an initiative proposed to Glico Insurance. The goal was to simplify and digitize the process of agents going around the country to collect business information, assess insurance statuses, and register new businesses for insurance policies. I created this app to make the process more efficient and environmentally friendly. The project was tested over a weekend, but Glico did not move forward with it after that.

### Features

- **Business Registration**: Allows agents to register a business, inputting details about the business and its owner.
- **Photo Capture**: Agents can take and upload multiple photos of the business during registration.
- **Authentication**: Implemented session-based authentication with user roles to manage agent and admin access securely.

### Challenges

I did not face any significant challenges during the development process, as I had already built similar functionality in previous projects.

### My Role

I handled both the **frontend** and **backend** development of the app using **Flutter** and **Firebase**. The UI design was provided by **Elvis**, the UI designer from my team.

### Timeline

The project lasted the entirety of **July 2023**, including design, development, and testing.

### Target Audience

The app was intended for use by **Glico Insurance** agents, designed to be extremely user-friendly for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise.

### Hosting

The app was not published on any app stores as it was developed for internal use by Glico Insurance.

### Future Plans

Although Glico didnâ€™t proceed with the project, I plan to adapt the app for use by any other company or organization that requires a similar tool, customizing it to fit their specific needs.

### Collaborators

- **Elvis**: UI Designer
- **Project Manager**: Proposed the idea and managed communication with Glico.

### Special Features

- **Session-Based Authentication**: Ensured that different user roles (agents, admins) could access the app securely, with access control based on roles.
