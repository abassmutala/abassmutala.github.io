### Overview  
The **EasyWaves Barber Competition** is a nationwide initiative aimed at discovering talented barbers across Ghana. To streamline the registration process for participants, I developed an Android app that allowed barbers to easily sign up and provide their profile information for the competition.

### Technologies Used  
#### Languages & Frameworks
- **Flutter** - Used for designing the user interface and managing app logic.
- **Firebase** - Employed for storing user data, authentication, and media uploads.

### App Features  
- **Barber Profile Registration:** The app includes a detailed form for barbers to enter their name, location, and professional details such as experience and special skills.
- **Photo Upload:** Barbers can upload images of their work to showcase their skills.
- **Video Introduction:** Participants can record and upload a short video introducing themselves and highlighting why they should be selected for the competition.
- **Firebase Integration:** All data, including images and videos, is securely stored in Firebase, ensuring reliable access for competition organizers.

### Challenges & Learnings  
One of the key challenges during development was optimizing the video upload feature to ensure that large files could be efficiently uploaded to Firebase without slowing down the app. I worked through Firebase's file compression and upload strategies to make the process seamless for users, which greatly improved the app's performance.

### Outcome  
The **EasyWaves Barber Competition** app was successfully launched in April 2024, with over 500 barbers registering within the first week. It has simplified the registration process, ensuring all participant data is stored in one central location for easy access by the competition organizers.

### Future Enhancements  
- **Competition Voting System:** I plan to add a feature where users can vote for their favorite barbers directly within the app.
- **Leaderboards:** A dynamic leaderboard system to showcase the top-performing barbers as the competition progresses.

### Conclusion  
Developing the **EasyWaves Barber Competition** app was an enriching experience that allowed me to further refine my Flutter and Firebase integration skills. The project has played a key role in organizing the competition efficiently, and I am eager to see how the app evolves with future updates. The app was developed over two months, and I look forward to enhancing it with additional features such as leaderboards and voting functionality.
